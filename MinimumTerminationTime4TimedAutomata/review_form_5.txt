The main contribution of this paper is proposing a modification to an existing
algorithm for computing the BCET (best-case execution time) in Timed Automata, so that
termination can always be guaranteed even if infinite cycles are present in the automata.

The authors used concrete examples to show that for timed automata with infinite cycles,
the algorithm for computing  proposed by Behrmann et al may not terminate. Then the authors analyzed 
the underlying defects of Behrmann et al 's algorithm that caused the non-termination; and finally
they provided a solution to the reported problem and proved its correctness. Generally speaking, 
this paper presents their achievements gradually in a reasonable order so that it makes the readers
tend to believe the authors' work really improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for computing BCET.

The summary of key difficulties and key contribution in introduction part is concise but expressive. 
 
There is a typo in the last paragraph of the introduction part: should be `The latter` instead of `The later`.

The extrapolation operation and canonicalization operation are mentioned again and again in the paper.
The definition 6 abstracts the implementation of extrapolation function, which is good; but it also makes
me raise a question: why there is no formal or informal definition for canonicalization function? 
The canonicalization function is equally important, in fact, the naive implementation of canonicalization
function is responsible for non-termination of Behrmann et al's algorithm in situations where infinite cycles
exist.  Only some general description of the canonicalization operation is available until the real use case
at the end of third part. I think it would be helpful for understanding if more noticeable explanation or
examples of canonical operation are given.
  
A good point of this paper is it used quite a few diagrams to increase the readability, which can even make it
easier for future internal reference. For example, in the third part, a matrix composed of dot sign (.) and
asterisk sign (*) is presented to denote the general form of partial extrapolated matrix. This representation 
makes very clear distinction between the "extra clock entries" that are not touched during extrapolation process
, and the entries only involve automata clocks which may be extrapolated. Later in the paper, the entries with certain
properties can be easily referenced by either "dot entries" or "asterisk entries", which is very concise.

One description that really confused me is the formal definition of best-case execution time. 
Definition 4 gave the formal representation of the best-case execution time of timed automata as 
the greatest lower bound of the set which contains all the execution times for a given set of runs.
This is easy to understand. But at the end of the paper where the Theorem 1 is given, it claims its algorithm for 
best-case execution time computes the least upper bound on execution times. This seems inconsistent with 
the previous definition of best-case execution time.
